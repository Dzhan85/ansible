## Playbook collection for basic management

Check how it works, use as examples

```
ansible-playbook playbook-mc.yml --check 

```

Debug and add features

```
ansible-playbook playbook-mc.yml --verbose

```

Fork and make me a PR. Or just make me a feature request.
p.s. Why not roles? Code should be short and effective. Find thousands of non-working roles in ansible-galaxy and have ~~fuck~~fun.
